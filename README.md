# Experiment - 2
**Aim:**<br>
a. To check the size of various data types.<br>
b. To check whether size of a datatype varies with different data types.<br>
<br>
**Theory:**<br>
Data types are the building blocks of variable declarations. The primary data types include integers (int), floating-point numbers (float, double), characters (char), and booleans (bool). Other than the basic few there are long and short int, signed and unsigned integer, long long integer and long double. Each of these types will have different memory aizes to store data.<br>
<br>
Storage classes in C++ helps us understand the lifespan, visibility, and memory location of variables. They include auto, register, static, extern, and mutable. 
*auto* - a variable's type automatically. <br>
*register* - the compiler to store the variable in a CPU register for quick access. <br>
*static* - retain their value between function calls and are confined to the file scope when declared outside functions. <br>
*extern* - the visibility of variables or functions to multiple files.<br>
*mutable* - a member of an object to alter its value whether or not it is a constant (const) on not.<br>
